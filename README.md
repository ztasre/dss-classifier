# Digit Substitution Test Model. 
Started July 16th. 2018. 
Two repos taken and consolidated. The first one was the mnist dataset but in png form. 
The second was a CoMnist (Comunist) nist dataset, which contains cyrillic letters that have symbols similar to that
of the dss test. I then rotated a bunch of the letters (ie. Russian P is rotated 90 degrees and 180 to generate detection
of DSS symbols. 

## Future: Attempt transfer learning off of a mnist trained model.
